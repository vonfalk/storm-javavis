	/**
	 * Defines a set implemented as a doubly-linked list within its elements. The elements are
	 * required to contain "next" and "prev" pointers of the same type as the template parameter to
	 * this class. This object is designed to keep track of a number of objects, and has therefore
	 * no support for multiple keys with the same "key". The key used in this set is the object
	 * pointer itself. The "prev" and "next" members are assumed to be initialized to zero at
	 * startup. Use the "SetMember" class to get this automatically.  The iterators in the set are
	 * designed to manage removal of the current item. Eg, iterator a = foo.begin(); foo.erase(*a);
	 * a++; is legal. Insertions during iterations will however fail in some cases.
	 *
	 * This implementation needs to be thread safe when a thread iterates through a set in the
	 * process of being modified. It is enough to be able to iterate through the entire list between
	 * any two machine instructions (disregarding any data visibility issues) since this is done by
	 * the GC when a thread to be scanned has been stopped at an arbitrary point. If iteration
	 * happens during insertion or removal, the node being modified may or may not be included in
	 * the iteration, but all other elements need to be visited by the iteration.
