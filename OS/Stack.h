	/**
	 * Stack description used by the UThread stack scheduler.
	 *
	 * This class may refer to a stack that was allocated by us, or to a stack that was allocated by
	 * the OS. Either way, the destructor handles deallocation properly.
	 *
	 * Note that a stack may be in two states. Either it is running or it is sleeping. If it is
	 * sleeping, the 'desc' member is valid, and the old stack pointer can be retrieved in that
	 * manner. Otherwise, the stack pointer must be found by examining all running threads
	 * (typically, the system knows which thread a particular stack belongs to, so it does not need
	 * to search for it).
	 *
	 * When a threada has been allocated, a sample "desc" is initialized. This description is
	 * located in the "cold" end of the stack, i.e. the end of the stack that will not be
	 * immediately overwritten. The "low" and "high" values are both initialized to the "hot" end of
	 * the stack, i.e. where values are to be pushed.
