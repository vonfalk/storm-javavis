	/**
	 * Description of a Type inside Storm.
	 *
	 * A type is either a *value*, a *class* or an *actor* (TObject). These have slightly different
	 * semantics. Most notably, values are always stored on the stack while the other two are
	 * heap-allocated. Furthermore, actors are associated with a specific thread, meaning that the
	 * system ensures that they are only accessed from that particular thread (it is, of course,
	 * possible to handle references to an actor from anywhere). It is convenient to wrap the type
	 * in a Value object to more easily query characteristics of a particular type. This also makes
	 * sure that references are handled properly.
	 *
	 * Furthermore, the class handles inheritance and the creation of various data structures
	 * required in the compiler, such as VTables (for virtual dispatch), type handles (for the
	 * templating mechanism used in Storm) and various wrapper functions.
	 *
	 * There are some peculiarities that need to be considered, mainly with regards to lazy loading:
	 *
	 * - During early compiler boot, all pointer members may be null even if not indicated
     *   otherwise. This includes name and parameters of the object, but also things like VTable and
     *   TypeChain. Code in C++ needs to be careful with regards to this.
	 *
	 * - VTables are only created when an object or any of its child objects are first instantiated.
	 *   Since the creation of VTables require loading all classes in an object hierarchy, eager
	 *   creation of VTables causes strange dependencies that causes seeminly unused types to be
	 *   loaded without reason just because some other type was added to the hierarchy in another
	 *   part of the system. Note that no VTables are created for value types.
