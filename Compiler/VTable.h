	/**
	 * The VTable implementation in Storm is split into three files. This one (VTable.h) contains
	 * the logical 'one and only' VTable implementation for a type. However, in Storm a VTable is
	 * split into two parts: the C++ VTable and the Storm VTable.
	 *
	 * The C++ VTable is managed by VTableCpp, and is binary compatible with C++. Storm produces its
	 * own derivatives to be able to extend classes declared in C++, but this has some
	 * limitations. For example, we can not dynamically add slots in the VTable without having to
	 * walk the heap and examine all living objects to see if we need to replace their VTables
	 * whenever the VTable shall be expanded.
	 *
	 * Instead, we store the dynamic part in the Storm VTable, which is managed by VTableStorm. For
	 * types declared in Storm, we store a pointer to the Storm VTable at the unused offset -1 in
	 * the C++ VTable. This allows us to change the Storm VTable for all living objects by simply
	 * altering one pointer. However, this indirection has a small penalty which we might want to
	 * get rid of eventually.
	 *
	 * If a vtable is set in this vtable, it is automatically updated in all vtables of the child
	 * class, as told by 'owner'. The vtable is also responsible for keeping vtable dispatch up to
	 * date if vtable slots are moved. We assume we will be notified when a child has been removed,
	 * and that we will be re-created whenever we gain a new parent.
	 *
	 * Note: As mentioned in the documentation for 'core.lang.Type', we assume that we do not need
	 * to eagerly load functions in child classes since they are not needed until that class is
	 * instantiated, in which case we will be notified. If we would eagerly load subclasses in this
	 * manner, we would create dependencies that are hard to realize.
	 *
	 * TODO: It might be possible to only store a bitmask in VTableCpp and VTableStorm that
	 * indicates if we have a new function set at this level or not.
