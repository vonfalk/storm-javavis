		 * in the beginning of the allocation, and the remainder of the allocation is the actual
		 * memory.
		 *
		 * Blocks can be considered to be garbage collected, as they are removed (or recycled) when
		 * all objects inside them have been removed.
		 *
		 * We assume memory inside the blocks are allocated from low addresses to high addressed
		 * simply by bumping a pointer, and the Block keeps track of this. Blocks are never moved,
		 * even though objects inside a block may move inside or between blocks.
