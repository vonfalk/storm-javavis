/**
 * Select the GC to use here.
 *
 * ZERO is just allocating memory without ever returning it. Usable as a template for new GC
 * implementations. Note: Storm will not shut down properly unless destructors are called, which the
 * ZERO gc does not do.
 *
 * MPS is currently the fastest GC supported, but requires all programs using it to make the source
 * code available (or to acquire another license for the MPS).
 *
 * SMM is a custom GC implementation for Storm. It is not yet as well-tested as MPS, but uses the
 * same license as the rest of Storm, thereby allowing binary releases of programs.
