	 * Describes a reference inside the generated code.
	 *
	 * The actual pointers for the references are stored inside the 'GcCodeRef' itself. These are
	 * the pointers that are actually scanned by the garbage collector, but the garbage collector
	 * will make sure to keep the described reference updated as well. Call
	 * 'runtime::codeUpdatePtrs' when all references have been filled in to update the references
	 * which 'offset' denotes.
	 *
	 * In the case of 'inside' references, the value stored in the 'pointer' member is a value to be
	 * interpreted as the offset within the current object, rather than an actual pointer.
	 *
	 * Note: If the LSB of the kind is set, the 'pointer' for that entry is scanned by the GC. To
	 * simplify, we use the entire least significant hex digit to indicate if the entry is scanned
	 * or not. The rest of the numbers are increasing as the enum would do normally.
